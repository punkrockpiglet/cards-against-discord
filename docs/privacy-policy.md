# Privacy Policy

**What end-user data does the bot store?**
```
The bot does not store any personally identifiable data. 
The bot stores only snowflake IDs of users, guilds, channels, and messages.

For example, my account snowflake ID is 238728915647070209, and that is all that gets stored in the database.
In addition, all IDs are deleted once a game is finished.
```

**Who does the bot share data with?**
```
The bot stores all information in a local database that never gets shared with a third party.
The only parties involved are Discord and the application itself.
```

**For how long are the data stored?**
```
All data related to a particular guild, channel, or user are deleted immediately after the game has been finished.
```

**How can I contact you, if I have concerns about the bot?**
```
The best option for you is to go to the Discord support server and ask questions there.
https://discord.com/invite/a5ZBRnFsu7
```

**How can I request data to be removed?**
```
The bot does not store any personally identifiable data, so there is no need to request data removal.
If you want non-identifiable data to be removed (for example, your snowflake ID), you can contact me via the support server,
and I can manually delete this information from the database.
